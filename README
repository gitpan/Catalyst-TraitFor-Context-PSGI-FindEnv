NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Context::PSGI::FindEnv - Hunt down our PSGI
    environment, even in 5.8x

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Context::PSGI::FindEnv - released October 31, 2012
    as part of Catalyst-TraitFor-Context-PSGI-FindEnv.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Catalyst context trait that aids in finding a PSGI
    environment, if one is available, even in a 5.8x environment.

    Note the key part about "if one is available" :) This is not always the
    case under 5.8x.

METHODS
  psgi_env
    This method will attempt to locate and return the PSGI environment
    hashref. If one is not found, nothing will be returned.

TRAIT APPLICATION
    Neither CatalystX::Component::Traits nor CatalystX::RoleApplicator
    handle applying context class traits at the moment.

  Directly in your application class
        with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Context::PSGI::FindEnv';

  In your PSGI file
    If you're only enabling this for debug purposes, it might be better to
    conditionalize this in your "app.psgi", with something like:

        Catalyst::TraitFor::Context::PSGI::FindEnv
            ->meta
            ->apply(Class::MOP::class_of('MyApp'))
            ;

    ...or, as that's a bit of a mouthful:

        use Moose::Util 'ensure_all_roles';
        ensure_all_roles MyApp => 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Context::PSGI::FindEnv';

    Both do the same thing (for generally indistinguishable values of "same
    thing").

    Note that your application class will need to be mutable (that is, not
    immutable) for these approaches to work.
